Mobile apps are ubiquitous, and their potential for creation and profit is undeniable. The Android app market is continually expanding with more and more apps being developed. In this project, we aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps available on Google Play, spanning various categories. Our goal is to extract valuable insights from the data and formulate strategies for driving growth and user retention in the highly competitive app market.

## Data Source

The data for this project has been sourced by scraping information from the Google Play website. While there are several popular datasets available for the Apple App Store, the availability of similar datasets for Google Play apps is relatively limited. This is primarily due to the increased complexity of scraping data from Google Play compared to the Apple App Store.

## Data Files

The project relies on two main data files:

1. **apps.csv**: This file contains comprehensive details about the apps available on Google Play. These details encompass various features and characteristics that describe each app.

2. **user_reviews.csv**: In this file, you'll find 100 reviews for each app, sorted in descending order of helpfulness. Each review's text has undergone preprocessing, been assessed by a sentiment analyzer engine, and tagged with its corresponding sentiment score.
